# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Brian Dudey]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 1, Monday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
Introduced to some JQuery Logic. 30 minutes of typing practice (forcing my hand placement to be correct is so hard!). 

### R1D2
Learning more about JavaScript Object(s) - I know it will click, eventually. Finished a challenge using CSS positions.
