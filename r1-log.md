# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Brian Dudey]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 1, Monday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
Introduced to some JQuery Logic. 30 minutes of typing practice (forcing my hand placement to be correct is so hard!). 
Two hours with mentor (Anna)

### R1D2
Learning more about JavaScript Object(s) - I know it will click, eventually. Finished a challenge using CSS positions.
Two hours with mentor (Anna)

### R1D3
Learned Git and GitHub. Worked on a project focused on HTML/CSS Forms. Got to challenge #16 on FreeCodeCamp. Dove deeper into JavaScript Objects
One hour with mentor (Anna)

#### R1D4
JavaScript, JavaScript, 
JavaScript, JavaScript,
JavaScript, JavaScript
JavaScript, JavaScript
GitHub

### R1D5
Realized I shorted myself a day on Twitter - fixed that. Got up to challenge #80 on FreeCodeCamp.
Also, continued my exploration of JavaScript objects which can include arrays and arrays can include objects
Two hours with mentor (Anna)

### R1D6
So many objects and arrays. I have moments where I think I get it and then others where it all escapes me. It really is a whole new language.

### R1D7
Tomorrow is my test and I am incredibly nervous. I know I have tried my best to get all the information down in an incredibly short period of time. We'll see how things go tomorrow. Wish me luck!

### R1D8
Passed my test. I officially start bootcamp in one week.

### R1D9
Trying not to be overwhelmed by jQuery. I honestly still have no idea what "it" is.

### R1D10
JavaScript links to jQuery and can make changes to the DOM. Ummmm. Yeah.

### R1D11
Still trying to make sense of the DOM tree. I understand the concept but am having a difficult time putting it into practice.

### R1D12
Feeling a bit overwhelmed with the amount of things I need to download and learn. Putting everything into practice is going to be a huge help.

### R1D13
Introduced to functionality of Node in a way that finally made sense. 

### R1D14
I took it easy today. Bootcamp starts tomorrow.

### R1D15
Bootcamp started. Git, GitHub, JavaScript. Working with a partner, Saugat.

### R1D16
Bootcamp Day 2. Arrays, While Loops, Arrays in Arrays. Totally different experience today - felt very lost.

##R1D17-R1D53
Bootcamp Day 3 - End of Week 5. Wow. I have learned so much in such a short period of time. I can't believe that I had no idea what an api was just 54 days ago. Now I know how to make an api. I have a long way to go though. Coding still does not feel natural to me and I do get lost easier than I'd like to admit but I know the work I am putting into this is going to pay off. Also, I just remembered that this page is, technically, public. So, anyone can read it. That would be weird.

##R1D54
I forgot I was meant to update this. Read about github and keeping up a good "commit streak" and that reminded me that I liked jotting down things in here. Hopefully, it will show me how far I have come once the 100 days is done.

##R1D55
Started learning about React and immediately jumping into a React side project so that I can do my best to stay ahead of the lightning bolt speed of my immersion course where we start learning React on Monday.
