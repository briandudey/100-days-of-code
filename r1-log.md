## Log

### R1D1 
Introduced to some JQuery Logic. 30 minutes of typing practice (forcing my hand placement to be correct is so hard!). 

### R1D2
Learning more about JavaScript Object(s) - I know it will click, eventually. Finished a challenge using CSS positions.

### R1D3
Learned Git and GitHub. Worked on a project focused on HTML/CSS Forms. Got to challenge #16 on FreeCodeCamp. Dove deeper into JavaScript Objects
