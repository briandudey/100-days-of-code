## Log

### R1D1 
Introduced to some JQuery Logic. 30 minutes of typing practice (forcing my hand placement to be correct is so hard!). 
Two hours with mentor (Anna)

### R1D2
Learning more about JavaScript Object(s) - I know it will click, eventually. Finished a challenge using CSS positions.
Two hours with mentor (Anna)

One hour with mentor (Anna)

### R1D5
Realized I shorted myself a day on Twitter - fixed that. Got up to challenge #80 on FreeCodeCamp.
Also, continued my exploration of JavaScript objects which can include arrays and arrays can include objects
Two hours with mentor (Anna)

### R1D6
So many objects and arrays. I have moments where I think I get it and then others where it all escapes me. It really is a whole new language.

### R1D7
Tomorrow is my test and I am incredibly nervous. I know I have tried my best to get all the information down in an incredibly short period of time. We'll see how things go tomorrow. Wish me luck!

### R1D8
Passed my test. I officially start bootcamp in one week.

### R1D9
Trying not to be overwhelmed by jQuery. I honestly still have no idea what "it" is.

### R1D10
JavaScript links to jQuery and can make changes to the DOM. Ummmm. Yeah.

### R1D11
Still trying to make sense of the DOM tree. I understand the concept but am having a difficult time putting it into practice.

### R1D12
Feeling a bit overwhelmed with the amount of things I need to download and learn. Putting everything into practice is going to be a huge help.
